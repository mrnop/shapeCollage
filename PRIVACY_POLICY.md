This Privacy Policy describes how IsaraInc ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information in connection with your use of our mobile application, ShapeCollage (the "App").

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Permissions
The App requires certain permissions to function effectively. We request the following permissions on your device:

*   **Storage (READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE):**
    *   **Purpose:** To allow you to select photos from your gallery to create collages and to save your created collages back to your device's storage.
    *   **Data Access:** We access only the images you specifically select. We do not scan or upload your entire library to our servers.

*   **Network (INTERNET, ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE, ACCESS_WIFI_STATE):**
    *   **Purpose:** To download additional assets such as fonts, shapes, or stickers, and to verify network connectivity for these downloads.
    *   **Data Access:** We may collect technical data (IP address, network type) required to establish connections.

*   **Phone State (READ_PHONE_STATE):**
    *   **Purpose:** This permission allows the App to handle interruptions properly, such as incoming calls, ensuring the App pauses or saves state correctly.
    *   **Data Access:** We do not record calls, phone numbers, or other personal identifiers associated with your phone calls.

### 1.2 User Data
The App is primarily a local tool for creating images.
*   **Images:** The photos you use and the collages you create are processed locally on your device. We do not automatically upload your personal photos to a cloud server for storage or analysis.
*   **Crash Logs:** In the event of an error, anonymous crash reports may be generated to help us fix bugs.
